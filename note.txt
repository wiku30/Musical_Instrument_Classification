Noticed that harmonic pattern is also relevent to its absolute frequency(because of resonance properties of the instrument). So naive analysis on harmonic patterns does not work.

For hammered string instruments(e.g. piano), harmonics decay faster than fundemental, so spectrum varies with time even in one note. May serve as a criteria of this type.

Now uses Hanning window in STFT instead of rectangle window to ameliorate sudden change on the edge.
